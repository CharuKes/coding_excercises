<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project analyzes gun-related data using a jupyter Notebook. It explores trends, disparities, and implications of gun-related deaths by examining factors such as time, education level, age group, race, location, and gender. Insights gained shed light on the complex nature of gun violence in the United States. This contains a [.ipynb file](https://github.com/CharuKes/finalCapstone/blob/main/other_projects/gun_deaths_in_the_US_2006-2020/gun-deaths-in-the-us-2006-2020.ipynb) and
dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/charukesharwani/gun-deaths-in-the-us-2006-2020/input).
